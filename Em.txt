Hi Steph,

Could you help us with this case? Tara submitted a request to gain access to an application, and for that, she asked to be added to a group. I added her, but she still couldnâ€™t access the application. I asked her for more information about the access, and she mentioned that you were able to set this up for Theodore. Do you know how I can help her gain access to this application?
