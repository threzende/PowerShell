Hello,

XXXXXX submitted some build requests in XXXXXXX, and the forms worked properly, and the builds were successfully completed. However, three of them are for SQL, and I was not able to find that option in the new form.

Do you have an image available for Windows Server 2022 with SQL?

Best regards,
