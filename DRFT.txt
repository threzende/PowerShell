Hello,
Sorry for the delay.
I spoke with Rodrigo, and he told me that the best way would be to open a decommission for the server SERVERXXXX, and open a new form build to build a new TS server named TSP, either with Windows Server 2019, or by cloning the server TSSERVER933.

However, cloning that system might not be ideal, since the current server is running Windows Server 2016.
